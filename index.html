				<h2>Hecarion: Cornell's Asian-American Hate Crime Support Group App</h2>

				<p> During the COVID pandemic, Asian-American hate crimes increased due
					to an increased propagation of negative stereotypes. We designed an
					app that would help Asian-American Cornell college students feel safe about their
					day-to-day activities. Our main features were a GPS that would direct users
					to a safer path using previous reported crimes, a spatial journal where
					people can journal their experiences, and a community where Asian-Americans
					can connect with each other. <b> This won the most socially-impactful project
						category at Cornell! </b> Hover over the infographic below to see
					more details!

				<h2>Analyzing the Effects of Cognitive Biases on the Accuracies of Microlaborers</h2>
				<p> Crowdsourcing information on microlabor platforms is integral to many ML projects.
					For example, if one needed a large amount of labeled data (e.g. image classification),
					this data can be split and assigned to hundreds of workers for a relatively low cost. However,
					the nature of how tasks are designed and the inherent biases held by microlaborers can affect
					the accuracies of the tasks. We did a case study observing the effect of overconfidence cognitive biases
					and anchoring cognitive biases on the accuracies of labeling satirical and non-satirical texts and
					generated and non-generated satirical texts from microlaborers on Amazon Turker. See our paper below!

				<h2> Artificial Intelligent Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe Agent </h2>
				<p> Ultimate tic-tac-toe is a board game that contains nine grids of traditional
					tic-toe-toe games to make a global game. In order to win ultimate tic-tac-toe, the players
					must win the global board by winning three local games in a row, column, or diagonal.
					Since the global game is indirectly affected by the local game, the
					complexity of the game is harder than that of traditional tic-tac-toe. Ultimate
					tic-tac-toe is an unsolved problem, unlike similar board games
					such as checkers and Go. We used multiple AI algorithms agents to simulate
					games to see which algorithm had the best chances of winning the game.
					The two key agents were a minimax algorithm and a Monte Carlo Tree Search
					(MCTS) algorithm. We used three heuristic functions for the minimax algorithms
					to test different facets of the game (local games versus global games,
					defensive versus offensive, etc.). We also implemented depth-bounded MCTS
					and alpha-beta pruning for minimax players for computational reasons. See our
					presentation below!
